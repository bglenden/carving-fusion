# Code Quality and Linting Guide

This project now includes comprehensive code quality tools integrated into the build system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run quick lint check (critical issues only)
make lint-quick

# Check code formatting 
make format-check

# Fix code formatting automatically
make format

# Run all quality checks before committing
make pre-commit
```

## Available Targets

### Linting Targets

- **`make lint`** - Full cpplint check with all rules
- **`make lint-quick`** - Fast lint check (ignores whitespace/style issues)  
- **`make lint-core`** - Lint only core source files (src/core/, src/geometry/, src/commands/)

### Formatting Targets  

- **`make format-check`** - Check if code needs formatting (dry run)
- **`make format`** - Auto-format all source code with clang-format

### Combined Targets

- **`make quality-check`** - Run comprehensive quality checks
- **`make pre-commit`** - Run quality checks suitable for pre-commit hook

## Current Status

**Compiler Warnings:** Reduced from ~20+ to 11 warnings  
**Lint Issues:** 110 total cpplint issues found

### Remaining Issues
Most lint issues are formatting/style related:
- Missing newlines at end of files (many files)
- Class indentation issues  
- Line length violations (>80 chars)
- Missing TODO usernames
- Whitespace/formatting issues

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Committing
```bash
make pre-commit
```

### Regular Development  
```bash
# Quick feedback during development
make lint-quick

# Fix formatting issues
make format
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add to your CI pipeline:
```bash
make quality-check
```

## Tool Requirements

- **cpplint**: `pip3 install cpplint` ✅ (installed)
- **clang-format**: `brew install clang-format` ✅ (available)

## Configuration

Lint filters are configured in CMakeLists.txt:
- Ignores: build includes, legal/copyright, casting warnings, namespace usage
- Line length limit: 120 characters (more reasonable than default 80)
- Recursive scanning of src/ directory

## Future Improvements

- Add clang-tidy integration for static analysis
- Create .clang-format configuration file
- Add pre-commit hooks integration
- Consider integrating with IDE/editor plugins
