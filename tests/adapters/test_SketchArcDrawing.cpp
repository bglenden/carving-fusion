/**
 * Test for sketch arc drawing functionality
 * 
 * This test would have caught the regression where addArcByThreePointsToSketch
 * was replaced with a stub implementation during the file split refactoring.
 * 
 * The test is non-fragile because it:
 * 1. Tests actual behavior (arcs are created) not implementation details
 * 2. Uses mock objects to avoid Fusion API dependencies
 * 3. Focuses on the point storage and arc creation workflow
 * 4. Tests error conditions and edge cases
